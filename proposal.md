# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Munchy Monkeys

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game where you control a monkey and collect as many bananas as you can in 60 seconds or until you hit a snake.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My game will have monkey that is controlled using the arrow keys on your keyboard or the WASD keys. I plan on doing this code in Visual Studios and using Visual Basics as the programming languages. When the program runs, there will be
an main menu screen. In this screen you there are instructions, with two big buttons that says easy and hard. Additionally, there will be music/sound playing in the game, and there is a smaller button that will allow it to toggle off.
When either easy or hard is pressed, there will be a count down and then the game will begin. In the game, there is a score counter and a time counter. Bananas will fall from the sky and so will snakes. If a banana is collected, it 
it is +1 on the score and if a snake is hit, then the game ends. At the end of the game, your score will appear and so will a try again button.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Main Menu, The monkey will be able to be controlled with WASD and the Arrow Keys, Bananas will Fall from the Sky, Score Counter, Time Counter

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Main Menu, The monkey will be able to be controlled with WASD and the Arrow Keys, Bananas will Fall from the Sky, Score Counter, Time Counter, Back Ground image, Music/ Sound, limited powerups for the character

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Main Menu, The monkey will be able to be controlled with WASD and the Arrow Keys, Bananas will Fall from the Sky, Score Counter, Time Counter, Back Ground image, Music/ Sound, limited powerups for the character, try again button,
all score lists in that session, 2x points power up, banana image don't overlap and look glitchy, smooth gameplay

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First I plan out the images that I need to use for the project. Then I will start with the main menu first, create the buttons and the background for it to work. Then I will set up the game, the easy game will have less snakes and 
bananas will drop slower, while the hard game there are more snakes and they bananas will drop faster. I have to plan out how many bananas I need to fall down and how to set them up so that they fall randomly onto the screen. I also
have to create 2 counters, one for the time and one for the points. I have to set constraints for both the time and if the monkey touches a snake. I then have to program what happens when the monkey touches the bananas. Lastly, I have to
program an endgame screen and a try again button and a list of past scores.

Most of the skills that I need to do this I already have but I will definitely need to relearn these skills. It has been around 2 years since I have use Visual Basics so I need to look at my notes and research online for even the basic
stuff. I think the biggest skill I have to acquire is how am I going to make the gameplay smooth and the bananas to overlap and not look glitchy. So the main topic I need to research is how to make moving images in Visual Basic not
glitch when they overlap.
